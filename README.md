# Homework

Homework assignments must be submitted in your own [homework
repository][], in a directory named according to the name of the
homework (e.g., `01_sorting`). 

[homework repository]: https://classroom.github.com/a/ExtCUY72

You are not allowed to use GitHub's web interface to submit assignments,
and you will be penalized for doing so. Submissions must be uploaded
using Git only. The commit message for the submission must strictly
adhere to the following format: `Submit homework 1`, where `1`
corresponds to the homework's number. If you want to modify your work
after is has been submitted, you can use the [conventional commit
message format][tpope]. For instance: `Add missing package
documentation`.
