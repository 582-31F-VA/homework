# Homework 7: Custom elements

Create a custom element named `word-count` that displays the total
number of words contained within all text nodes inside it. For instance,
given the following markup, the counter should display 6.

```html
<word-count>
    <p>I am within a <i>custom element</i>.</p>
</word-count>
```
