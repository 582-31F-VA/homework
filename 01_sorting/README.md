# Homework 1: Modules

The `students.js` module contains data about students. Using JavaScript,
populate the table inside the `index.html` document. Clicking on a
column header should allow users to sort rows according to the values
for that row. Clicking multiple times on the same header should toggle
between ascending and descending order. The code for populating the
table should be in a `table.js` module. The logic for sorting rows
should be in a `sort.js` module. The `main.js` module should only be
responsible for putting everything together. Public functions (i.e.,
functions exported by a module) should be documented using JSDoc.
